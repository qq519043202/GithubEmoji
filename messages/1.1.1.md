# GithubEmoji 1.1.1 Changelog

## Bug Fixes

* Completions are now working for documents with scope `text.html.markdown` instead of files with extensions of `.md` and `.markdown`. This fixes the issue of completions working only on **saved** markdown files. Additionaly the `emojiFileExtensions` array in the default settings has been replaced with an `emojiScopes` array containing scopes that emoji completions are enabled.
